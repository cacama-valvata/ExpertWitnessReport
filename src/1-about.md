## Background Information About the Case

This case is investigating the report of a missing person, William "Willy" Yeats. Yeats was last seen on March 8th, 2021 at around 10 PM at the Rogue Pier 39 Public House in Astoria, Oregon. His sailboat was found by the U.S. Coast Guard capsized off the coast of Cape Disappointment, Washington, on March 10th, 2021. His 2019 Toyota Tundra was parked at his dock in Portland. He has been reported missing since.

On the evening of March 7th, a Lake Oswego neighbor reported a "young man in a hoodie" throwing "something heavy" in a dumpster. The Lake Oswego Police Department responded to the scene and retrieved a large PC (an HP Z230) from the dumpster. The garbage was scheduled to be picked up the following morning (Monday).

The serial number of the PC indicated that it was originally purchased by Rose City, the software company where Yeats was a founder and employee. Yeats had purchased the PC for personal use during a refresh cycle. Fingerprints found on the PC matched those found in Yeats' apartment.

The Lake Oswego Police Department then transferred control of the PC to the State Police who transferred it to the Oregon Forensics Laboratory. This expert witness report will be focused on the analysis of the hard drive found in the HP Z230 PC.

## Summary of Process

In my procedure, I analyzed the registry keys on the system, the shellbags of the users present on the system, the system's event logs, and application data. In each relevant section, I detail more about each component's relevancy to the case as well as how to interpret information found in each component.
