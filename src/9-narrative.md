# Appendix C: Theory of Narrative {-}

My theory of the crime is that a couple (Yeats and Gonne) who owned a prominent software development business in Portland, Oregon, planned to defraud their company in order to buy a private island and run away together.

They had been planning this since before November 7th, 2020, when the hard drive on Yeats' server died, and he was forced to reinstall the server. Any evidence earlier than this point is lost. Yeats joins his computer to the `byzantiumus.com` domain, installs email software, and begins communicating with Gonne again.

In early emails, Yeats and Gonne speculate on ways they can build the money they need in order to buy the private island without stirring too much suspicion. They would later go on to phish Rose City into sending them $13 million, which was then moved into an offshores bank account.

The couple also needed to set up fake identities to reduce the ability of authorities to track them down through avenues like money or flights. They wanted to leave Rose City behind entirely. To get new identities, Yeats explotied a SQL injection vulnerability in the Province of British Columbia's birth certificate database to create two false records for themselves. He requested copies of the birth certificates and used these to apply for two Canadian passports. They would need the passports in order to travel abroad. To further hide his tracks, Yeats also attempted to hide these documents in unrelated images sent via email. 

At various times, Yeats and Gonne traveled in order to secure parts of their plan, such as actually buying the island. In addition, they went to Vancouver, BC, Canada in order to get married since they believed that it would make the process of buying the island and transitioning into their new lives easier.

Yeats sets up a new Swiss banking account and transfers the money into it. He sends this information to Gonne. The account balance sent to Gonne at this time is representative of after they had made the purchase of the island. They had defrauded Rose City of $13 million, and at the point of communication, they had only 248,764 â‚¬ within it.

On the evening of March 7th, 2021, Yeats sends Gonne her boarding passes to arrive at the island and urges her to move as quickly as possible. Her boarding passes show that she is scheduled to arrive on the island on March 14th, 2021. Yeats also says that he is going to delete his cloud server as well as dumping the PC server, presumably in an attempt to hide the evidence. He urges her to throw her laptop "in the river" as well. 

It is on this evening that a neighbor witnesses someone dump the PC in a dumpster and alerts the authorities. The Lake Oswego Police Department collect the PC from the dumpster and begin their investigation. After dumping the PC, Yeats drives to Astoria, Oregon, where his sailboat is; this is where he is last seen by locals at a local bar. He intentionally capsizes his boat off of Cape Disappointment, Washington, in order to create a different story for the missing person's report. He begins driving back to the airport in order to catch his flight to the island. However, the vehicle he takes is unknown, as he left his own truck at the dock in Astoria which is later found by police. On March 10th, 2021, the U.S. Coast Guard finds his sailboat in Cape Disappointment with no persons present nearby.

By this point, he and Gonne are on their flights to Mexico City and then to their island.
