Canada is all taken care of, although we'll need to make a trip there
soon. I'll fill you in later.
All that remains is my trip south of the equator. Will cost about $200k
for the both of us. You can judge how much a bonus would be
suspicious--be nice to make a down payment on the property.

We're all ready to go now. One more for you, but I don't want to send that in the clear--probably being paranoid.

Remember when we took CS373 together--the way we started sharing things after that lab? Yeah. Next time.

Well, aren't you the clever one. I knew there was a reason I fell in love with you all over again.

Can't say that I'm all that thrilled about getting married again so soon. I guess it is worth it if you think it will help. Don't islanders like to live in sin these days?

We're going to have to be more careful at work. I don't know if people have noticed us yet, but we are spendinga lot more time together and we can't keep using the new building as an excuse.

Ha--that's all real!

Found that someone isn't very careful with their coding. A little SQL
injection and, viola, 2 birth records added. From there it was just a
matter of ordering a copy of our birth certificates.

Once I was up there, it was easy to get the passports. The nice lady
made an exception for you being present, given that we'd been away on a
mission with our parents for the last several years and you wanted to
get home so bad for our wedding. :)

Still open for a trip to Vancouver on Saturday?

See you there.

Ok, I'm heading out. I'm flying into to Vancouver, will pick up the car
and drive down so our registration will match our passports as we cross
the border. I'll meet you at that Indian restaurant in Redmond at 11ish.

We're scheduled at the Commissioner at 4, so should be plenty of time.

It'll make it much easier--and we'll save $180k this way.

It was actually a really nice time, wasn't it. Be good when we can finally be together, Ms. McCrae.
Well, Jack got what he deserved. That ass. 
Sunday night--everyone on the team thinks I'm sailing in Baja.  I arrive at VLI at noon on Tuesday--have to go through Sydney, and only one flight a day, so a bit of a layover.
I'm going to move this server to AWS this weekend--we shouldn't use it when it is up there. Our Palo Alto will throw an alert on traffic from domains that have recently changed, and I don't want anyone looking into it.
Oh, got the accounts set up. I'll send you the info. Thank god for bitcoin.

All I can say is about damn time. Should've never let Jack talk us into going IPO.

Have to say you cleaned up pretty nice, and that celebrant was a hoot. Sorry you had to drive back up from Redmond, but understand things need to add up. When do you head out?

I can't wait to get back to the tropics. So much fun.

We did pretty good with bitcoin. . .made a few quid by the time 
everything went through.

As soon as it hits GD it will be moved.

See you tomorrow

Money has been moved. You know the plan. Text me as soon as you get 
this, so I can delete the server and throw this system away--I have to 
move fast if I'm going to make my flight after driving from Astoria.

If for some reason we can't connect in Mexico City, keep going--I'll 
meet you there. Malvanua. -15.359212, 167.193547. We own the whole 
thing, so stay in the big house. :)

Print these out, then throw your laptop in the river.

We should be there before anyone notices anything wrong.
